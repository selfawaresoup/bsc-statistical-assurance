	abstract = {The sample size necessary to obtain a desired level of statistical power depends in part on the population value of the effect size, which is, by definition, unknown. A common approach to sample-size planning uses the sample effect size from a prior study as an estimate of the population value of the effect to be detected in the future study. Although this strategy is intuitively appealing, effect-size estimates, taken at face value, are typically not accurate estimates of the population effect size because of publication bias and uncertainty. We show that the use of this approach often results in underpowered studies, sometimes to an alarming degree. We present an alternative approach that adjusts sample effect sizes for bias and uncertainty, and we demonstrate its effectiveness for several experimental designs. Furthermore, we discuss an open-source R package, {BUCSS}, and user-friendly Web applications that we have made available to researchers so that they can easily implement our suggested methods.},

	abstract = {A well designed clinical trial requires an appropriate sample size with adequate statistical power to address trial objectives. The statistical power is traditionally defined as the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis with a pre-specified true clinical treatment effect. This power is a conditional probability conditioned on the true but actually unknown effect. In practice, however, this true effect is never a fixed value. Thus we discuss a newly proposed alternative to this conventional statistical power: statistical assurance, defined as the unconditional probability of rejecting the null hypothesis. This kind of assurance can then be obtained as an expected power where the expectation is based on the prior probability distribution of the unknown treatment effect, which leads to the Bayesian paradigm. In this paper, we outline the transition from conventional statistical power to the newly developed assurance and discuss the computations of assurance using Monte-Carlo simulation-based approach.},

            This paper describes the distinction between the concept of statistical power and the probability of getting a successful trial. While one can choose a very high statistical power to detect a certain treatment effect, the high statistical power does not necessarily translate to a high success probability if the treatment effect to detect is based on the perceived ability of the drug candidate. The crucial factor hinges on our knowledge of the drug's ability to deliver the effect used to power the study. The paper discusses a framework to calculate the ‘average success probability’ and demonstrates how uncertainty about the treatment effect could affect the average success probability for a confirmatory trial. It complements an earlier work by O'Hagan et al. (Pharmaceutical Statistics 2005; 4:187–201) published in this journal. Computer codes to calculate the average success probability are included.
